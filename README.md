## 🌦️ Weather Data Aggregator (Go)

A complete CLI-based weather data aggregator demonstrating **parallel programming concepts in Go**.

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Location**: [`weather-aggregator/`](./weather-aggregator/)  
**Focus**: Concurrency with goroutines and channels, parallel API fetching, error handling

### Quick Start

```bash
cd weather-aggregator
go build -o weather-aggregator
./weather-aggregator --city=Berlin
```

**Key Features**:
- Concurrent API calls using goroutines and channels
- Real-time data aggregation from multiple weather APIs
- Performance comparison (concurrent vs sequential)
- Comprehensive unit tests and benchmarks
- Clean, idiomatic Go code

See the [Weather Aggregator README](./weather-aggregator/README.md) for detailed documentation.
